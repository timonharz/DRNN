 Dynamic Reproducing Neural Network (DRNN)

## Overview

The Dynamic Reproducing Neural Network (DRNN) project is dedicated to the exploration and development of a groundbreaking neural network architecture. Unlike traditional networks, the DRNN possesses the unique ability to dynamically modify its structure through neuron reproduction. This research initiative delves into the implementation of DRNN from the ground up, leveraging Python and the NumPy library to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.

## Features

- **Dynamic Reproduction:** The core feature of DRNN is its capacity to dynamically reproduce neurons, allowing for adaptive structural changes during the learning process.

- **Deep Learning Exploration:** The project is designed to investigate the potential of DRNN in solving complex problems through deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the DRNN project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DRNN.git

	2.	Install Dependencies:

pip install numpy


	3.	Explore the Code:
Dive into the Python codebase to understand the DRNN implementation and its unique architecture.

Usage

To use DRNN in your own projects, follow these steps:

	1.	Import DRNN:

from drnn import DRNN


	2.	Initialize DRNN:

drnn = DRNN(input_size, output_size)


	3.	Train the Model:

drnn.train(training_data, epochs)


	4.	Evaluate Performance:

accuracy = drnn.evaluate(test_data)
